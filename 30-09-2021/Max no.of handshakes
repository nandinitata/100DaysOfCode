every person should shakehand with every other person in the room. For the first person, there would be N-1 people to shake hands. For second person there would N-2 people available but as he had already shaken hands with the first person,  there would be N-2 people to shake hands and so on.

Therefore the total number of handshake = (N-1 + N-2 +….+ 1 + 0)=((N-1)*N)/2.

        cout<<“Maximum number of handshakes: “;
        int max=p*(p–1)/2;
        cout<<max;
        return 0;
